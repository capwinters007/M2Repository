<div>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a tail.</div>
<div>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous.</div>
<div>As Knowledge increases, wonder deepens</div>
<p>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never 
alone.</p>
<p>The best and the most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart.</p>
<p>It is during our darkest hours that we must focus to see the light.</p>
<p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future. It is something you design for the present.</p>
<p>Be faithful to that which exist within yourself.</p>
